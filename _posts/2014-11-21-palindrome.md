This post is the first one of a series that can be summed up using the following question:

*How can one detect formal figures of speech with code?*

While detecting metaphors and other similes might be nearly impossible and require a huge deal of [Natural Language Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) tools, formal figures of speech are way easier to discover in text.

My point here is that it is even fun to do so.

So now onto our subject: the *palindrom*!
