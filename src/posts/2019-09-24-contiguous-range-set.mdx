  Picture the scene: using Twitter APIs, we have collected a gazillion of tweets.
  <SideNote id="gazouilloire">If you ever need to do so, <SafeLink href="https://github.com/medialab/gazouilloire">gazouilloire</SafeLink> is probably a safe bet as it has been used for several years by Sciences Po's <SafeLink href="https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en">m√©dialab</SafeLink> for their Twitter data collections.</SideNote>
  Now our attention focuses on the millions of shared hyperlink we found in those.
</p>

<p>
  What if we could go further than ranking those urls? What if we could extract their raw textual content
  <SideNote id="dragnet">
    Extracting the main content from a web page, i.e. from its HTML representation, is not a trivial task. The <SafeLink href="https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet">dragnet</SafeLink> library, for instance, should get you going.
  </SideNote>
  so we can test some of our NLP (<SafeLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language Processing</SafeLink>) mojo on it?
</p>

But there is a catch! Before being able to do so, we obviously need to fetch those urls. And grabbing millions of urls from the web ought to be slow.

However, it is not entirely hopeless: The first thing to avoid is to fetch urls sequentially. To dramatically speed up their collection, we can fetch a bunch of them in parallel, granted they are not from the same domain, using multi-threaded execution.
